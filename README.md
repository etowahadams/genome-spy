GenomeSpy is a visualization toolkit for genomic (and other) data. It features a
visualization grammar inspired by [Vega-Lite](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/)
and a high-performance, WebGL-powered graphics renderer.

Documentation and examples can be found at https://genomespy.app/

## Monorepo

GenomeSpy is split into several [packages](./packages/), two of which, core and
app, are the most important:

### Core

The [core](./packages/core/) library provides the visualization grammar and a
WebGL-powered rendering engine.

### Cohort App

The [app](./packages/app/) builds upon the core, extending the visualization
grammar with support for faceting multiple (up to thousands of) patient samples.
It provides a user interface for interactive analysis of the samples, which can
be filtered, sorted, and grouped flexibly. The app includes session handling
with provenance, URL hashes, and bookmarks.

### Embed Examples

The [embed-examples](./packages/embed-examples/) package contains examples of
how to embed GenomeSpy in web applications and use the
[API](https://genomespy.app/docs/api/) for advanced use cases.

## Contributing

### Bootstrapping and running

1. `git clone git@github.com:genome-spy/genome-spy.git`
2. `cd genome-spy`
3. `npm install` (use npm7!)
4. `npm start` (starts a development server with the app package)

The `packages/core/examples` directory contains some random view specification
that can be accessed through urls like
`http://localhost:8080/?spec=examples/first.json`.

The `packages/core/private/` directory is in `.gitignore` and served by the
development server: `http://localhost:8080/?spec=private/foo.json`. Use it for
experiments that should not go into version control.

If you want to use or develop the core library, launch a single-page app using:
`npm -w @genome-spy/core run dev`
